I‚Äôm a Software Developer who loves building things that are not just functional but also a joy to use. My secret sauce? A solid mix of Java, Spring Boot, and Angular to cook up full-stack applications that are scalable, reliable, and maybe a little bit magical. I live for a good challenge and am always on the hunt for ways to make code faster, cleaner, and more robust.
